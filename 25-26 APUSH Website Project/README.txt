For my Open House project, our group decided on making a website. Websites are quite complex to set up, but upon some planning, we have managed to code our own website from the ground up using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript.

\>> How to open it
All you have to do is just click `index.html`. If it asks you to open it in a certain app, pick a browser like Google Chrome.
